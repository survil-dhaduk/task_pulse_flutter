# Title: Implement Task Sorting and Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement sorting and filtering of tasks by status (completed/incomplete) and sorting by date or priority. Update the task list UI to reflect the applied filters and sorting options.
# Details:
1.  Add sorting and filtering options in the task list UI (e.g., dropdown menus, checkboxes).
2.  Update the `TaskBloc` to handle sorting and filtering events.
3.  Modify the `getTasks` use case to apply the selected filters and sorting options.
4.  Update the task list UI to display the filtered and sorted tasks.

# Test Strategy:
Write widget tests to verify that the sorting and filtering options are displayed correctly, and that the task list updates based on the selected options.
