			"taskTitle": "Initialize Flutter Project and Folder Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for creating the Flutter project, creating core directories, creating feature directories, and updating `pubspec.yaml` with dependencies.",
			"reasoning": "Basic project setup with clear steps. Complexity arises from dependency management and platform configuration, but these are relatively straightforward."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Dependency Injection (GetIt)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into adding the dependency, creating the service locator file, initializing GetIt, registering core services, and registering repositories.",
			"reasoning": "Requires understanding of dependency injection principles and `get_it` package. Registration of services and repositories can become complex based on the application's architecture."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for implementing each use case: `CreateTask`, `UpdateTask`, `DeleteTask`, `GetTasks`, and `ToggleTaskCompletion`.",
			"reasoning": "Involves defining business logic and handling success/failure scenarios using `dartz`. The complexity increases with the number of use cases."
