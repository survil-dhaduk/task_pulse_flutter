# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Flutter Project and Folder Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Flutter project with the necessary configurations and folder structure as outlined in the PRD, including setting up the core and feature directories.
# Details:
1.  Create a new Flutter project: `flutter create task_pulse`
2.  Create the core and feature directories inside `lib/`.
3.  Inside `lib/features/`, create the `task_management` directory.
4.  Inside `task_management`, create `data`, `domain`, and `presentation` directories.
5.  Update `pubspec.yaml` with initial dependencies: `flutter_bloc`, `hive`, `flutter_local_notifications`, `get_it`, `dartz`. Use the latest stable versions.
6.  Configure Flutter environment for Android and iOS platforms.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the folder structure is correctly set up and the `pubspec.yaml` file contains the required dependencies. Run `flutter pub get` to ensure all dependencies are fetched successfully.
