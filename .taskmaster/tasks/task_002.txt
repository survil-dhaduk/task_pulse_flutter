# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Dependency Injection (GetIt)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up dependency injection using `get_it` to manage dependencies across the application. This includes registering core services and repositories.
# Details:
1.  Add `get_it` as a dependency in `pubspec.yaml`.
2.  Create a `service_locator.dart` file in the `core` directory.
3.  Initialize `GetIt` instance.
4.  Register core services (e.g., Hive service) as singletons.
5.  Register repositories as singletons or factories as needed.

Example:
```dart
final sl = GetIt.instance;

Future<void> init() async {
  // Services
  sl.registerSingleton<HiveService>(HiveServiceImpl());

  // Repositories
  sl.registerLazySingleton<TaskRepository>(() => TaskRepositoryImpl(hiveService: sl()));
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to verify that dependencies are correctly registered and can be resolved using `GetIt.instance.get<DependencyType>()`.
