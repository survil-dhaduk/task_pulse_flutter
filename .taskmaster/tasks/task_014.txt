# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Write unit tests for entities, use cases, and repositories. Write BLoC tests for state transitions and logic. Write widget tests for UI validation and interaction. Write integration tests for end-to-end task flow with database and notifications.
# Details:
1.  Write unit tests for entities to ensure that they can be created and their properties can be accessed.
2.  Write unit tests for use cases to ensure that they correctly interact with the repository and return the expected results.
3.  Write unit tests for repositories to ensure that they correctly interact with Hive and store and retrieve data accurately.
4.  Write BLoC tests to ensure that the `TaskBloc` correctly handles events, interacts with use cases, and emits the expected states.
5.  Write widget tests to ensure that the UI is displayed correctly and interacts with the `TaskBloc` as expected.
6.  Write integration tests to ensure that the end-to-end task flow works correctly, including database interactions and notifications.

# Test Strategy:
Run all tests and ensure that they pass. Aim for >90% code coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Unit Test Entities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write unit tests for entities to ensure that they can be created and their properties can be accessed correctly.
### Details:
Create tests to verify entity creation and property access.

## 2. Unit Test Use Cases and Repositories [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write unit tests for use cases to ensure they correctly interact with the repository and return expected results. Also, write unit tests for repositories to ensure they correctly interact with Hive and store/retrieve data accurately.
### Details:
Create tests to verify use case interactions with repositories and repository interactions with Hive.

## 3. BLoC Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write BLoC tests to ensure the `TaskBloc` correctly handles events, interacts with use cases, and emits the expected states.
### Details:
Use the `bloc_test` package to verify event handling, use case interaction, and state emission.

## 4. Widget Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write widget tests to ensure the UI is displayed correctly and interacts with the `TaskBloc` as expected.
### Details:
Verify UI display and interaction with the `TaskBloc` using widget tests.

## 5. Integration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write integration tests to ensure the end-to-end task flow works correctly, including database interactions and notifications.
### Details:
Verify the complete task flow, including database interactions and notification scheduling.
