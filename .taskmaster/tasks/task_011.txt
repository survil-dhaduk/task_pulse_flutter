# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Task Search
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement task searching by title or description. Update the task list UI to display the search results.
# Details:
1.  Added a debounced search bar in `TaskListScreen` AppBar bottom using a `TextField` and 300ms debounce.
2.  Wired to `TaskBloc` `SearchTasks` event; empty query triggers `LoadTasks` to reset.
3.  Used existing `SearchTasks` use case and repo method to filter by title/description.
4.  Handled `TaskSearching` and `TaskSearchResults` states in UI, including result count hint and loading overlay.

# Test Strategy:
Write widget tests to verify that the search bar is displayed correctly, and that the task list updates based on the search query.
