# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Task Creation/Edit UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the UI for creating and editing tasks, including input fields for title, description, due date, and priority. Use appropriate date/time pickers and priority badges.
# Details:
1.  Create a `task_form_screen.dart` file in `lib/features/task_management/presentation/pages/`.
2.  Use `TextFormField` widgets for input fields.
3.  Use `showDatePicker` and `showTimePicker` for date and time selection.
4.  Implement priority selection using radio buttons or dropdown.
5.  Use `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder` to manage the form state and interact with the `TaskBloc`.

# Test Strategy:
Write widget tests to verify that the task form is displayed correctly, input fields accept valid data, and the form submits data to the `TaskBloc` correctly.
