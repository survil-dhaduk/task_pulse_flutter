# Task ID: 3

# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Define the core data models (entities) for the task management feature, including `Task` with properties like title, description, dueDate, priority, and completion status.
# Details:
1.  Create a `task.dart` file in `lib/features/task_management/domain/entities/`.
2.  Define the `Task` class with necessary properties.
3.  Implement `Equatable` for easy comparison of `Task` instances.

Example:
```dart
class Task extends Equatable {
  final String id;
  final String title;
  final String description;
  final DateTime dueDate;
  final Priority priority;
  final bool isCompleted;

  const Task({
    required this.id,
    required this.title,
    required this.description,
    required this.dueDate,
    required this.priority,
    required this.isCompleted,
  });

  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [id, title, description, dueDate, priority, isCompleted];
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to ensure that `Task` objects can be created, their properties can be accessed, and `Equatable` is correctly implemented.
